## Overview
We are Front-End students at the Turing School of Software and Design. This project was our paired project for Module 2, and was built with a focus on learning how to use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation on large datasets.

### Abstract
This app is an activity tracker that offers a look into the user's health data for a given week. It displays activity, hydration, and sleep data. There are in depth insights for the current day, as well as several graphs visualizing weekly data. There is also a section to vew the global average activity of all users for the current day. 

### Goals

* Gaining a better understanding of ES6 and test-driven-design. 
* Learning to translate original composition into a website
* Getting comfortable with array prototype methods
* Working with large datasets

## Design

  Our layout Is based on common activity tracking apps. We organized categories by what we thought the most useful data was, keeping the high priority data at the top.
  We specifically took inspiration from popular sleep apps to create a calm design, while using pops of color to keep the app lively.

 ## Challenges  
 
 We faced some difficulties in importing npm packages into our project while keeping browser compatibility. Along the same lines, ran into some errors while attempting to instatiate data objects within data repository classes due to the way the browser compiles all the files into one global scope.

 ## Successes
 
We managed to overcome the browser issues we faced and successfully import npm packages to properly manipulate our data and display nicely on the page. A big win for us was when we finally were displaying weekly data for a user's sleep data existing in a repository. This project really managed to make us to wrap our heads around how iterator methods can efficiently manipulate data.
