## Overview
This was the final project for Module 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. This app acted as a culmination of everything I had learned in the module. Iterator methods, fetch requests, SASS and proper test-driven-design were all utilized in this application.

### Abstract
This app is an a travel agency website, that allows a user to choose from a selection of locations and request a trip. Options for the trip include the date, the quantity of travelers, and the duration of the trip.

### Goals

* Gaining a better understanding fetch, and seperating functionality into their own files.
* Learning to build a website from the ground up that can interact with an API
* Getting more comfortable with iterator methods in relation to API datasets
* Updating large datasets

 ## Challenges  
 
I faced some challenges in how I approached this project. I initially didn't create class instantiations of my API objects, which made functionality and testing limited. I also found some complications in fetches depending on each other. This led to some fetch request chains that are a little messy. I hope to go back and refactor.

 ## Successes
 
I'm really pround of this site! It is a good feeling to see something developed from the ground up and come out with a clean and polished product by the end. I'm especially happy with the layout, as I was able to get a pleasant and responsive site both in desktop and mobile view.
